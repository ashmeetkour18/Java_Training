What is the difference between a Set and a List

1) List is an ordered collection it maintains the insertion order, which means upon displaying the list content it will
display the elements in the same order in which they got inserted into the list, while Set is an unordered collection,
it doesn’t maintain any order.

2) List allows duplicates while Set doesn’t allow duplicate elements.

3) List allows any number of null values. Set can have only a single null value at most.

4) ListIterator can be used to traverse a List in both the directions(forward and backward) However it can not be used
to traverse a Set. We can use Iterator (It works with List too) to traverse a Set.
