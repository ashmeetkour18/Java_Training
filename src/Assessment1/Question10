What is the difference between Hashmap and LinkedHashmap?

The main difference between HashMap and LinkedHashMap is that LinkedHashMap maintains the
insertion order of keys, the order in which keys are inserted into LinkedHashMap.
On the other hand, HashMap doesn't maintain any order or keys, or values.
