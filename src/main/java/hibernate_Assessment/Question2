2. What is the name of the default hibernate configuration file? What is the property name that is used to automatically
create the table in case the table is not there.

Hibernate requires a set of configuration settings related to database and other related parameters. All such
information is usually supplied as a standard Java properties file called hibernate.properties, or as an XML file named
hibernate.cfg.xml.

hbm2ddl.auto Create :
If the value is CREATE then the hibernate first drops the existing tables data and structure, then creates new tables
and executes the operations on the newly created tables.

hbm2ddl.auto update :
If the value is update then, Hibernate checks for the table and columns. If a table doesn’t exist then it creates new
tables and where as if a column doesn’t exist it creates new columns for it.

hbm2ddl.auto create-only:
The database schema will be generated.It will execute for the first time once the table is created and record is
inserted and executing this again gives an error "Table already exist".It will create the table only once.
